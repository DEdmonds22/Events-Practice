// WHAT ARE DOM EVENTS? //
    /* DOM events are the bedrock of interactivity on web pages. */
    /* DOM events enable us as developers to implement event-driven programming. This programming paradigm is such that much of our code runs in response to events being triggered during run-time. */
    /* Lots of events are being generated within the browser, for example, when:
        + A user moves or clicks the mouse.
        + A user presses a key.
        + When a form is submitted.
        + When the page has finished loading or has been resized.
        + ect. */
